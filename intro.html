Hi! My name is Calvin Nguyen and I am from Long Island, New York. I attended Deer Park High School, where I had a really great high school career to be honest. 
In high school, I was ranked second in my class, giving the the title of Salutatorian. I was also elected in numerous leadership positions in honor societies and 
other extracurriculars, those of which I am not going to list out because that would just be way too much. A very interesting fun fact about me was that I was 
elected Homecoming King, which is a testament to the character and role model status I had in my community. Outside of scholastic achievements, I enjoy wathcning movies especially Disney ones, 
playing soccer with friends and also going to the gym often to maintain my health. Those are primarily my main hobbies, all of which contribute to my mental and physcial well-being.
